      <p>This document outlines various accessibility-related user needs and requirements for both synchronous and asynchronous web-based collaboration tools based on various collaborative engagement scenarios. These tools typically include one or more specific collaborative features such as
      content editing by multiple authors, support for comments annotations, and revision control in real-time synchronous sessions, or asynchronously. Asynchronous tools are more commonly known as revision control systems rather than collaboration tools though their functionality is otherwise very similar. The Cloud-based office application suites from Google and Microsoft are well-known examples of synchronous, real-time collaboration tools, though they also support asynchronous collaboration. Web tools built on git are well-known examples of asynchronous collaboration tools.</p>
      <p>The accessibility user needs and requirements described in this document may be implemented in the collaboration tool itself, or in an assistive technology application such as a screen reader or screen magnifier. Widely used desktop applications such as word processors and spread sheets also commonly support collaboration features. We take a holistic approach to give foremost priority to the user&apos;s perspective, leading to the identification of features and solutions that may be implemented by different components of the software stack involved in performing a collaborative task.</p>
      <p>Although the user needs and requirements identified in this document <em>are non-normative</em>, they may influence the development of future accessibility guidelines, normative technical specifications, or features of collaboration tools and assistive technologies. They are relevant to software developers who contribute to the collaborative experience.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <section id="collaboration-tools">
        <h3>What are collaboration tools?</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this document, a <dfn>collaboration tool</dfn> is any software that supports features designed to facilitate the interactive creation, editing or annotation of content by multiple contributors, whether working in simultaneous collaboration or asynchronously. Examples of collaboration tools include</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Web-based text editor or word processor that enables multiple authors to edit content simultaneously while discussing their edits during a Real Time Communications (<abbr title="Real Time
			  Communications">RTC</abbr>) teleconference, with each contributor&apos;s changes being integrated into the resulting text and propagated in real time to the collaborators.</li>

	  <li>A Web-based text editor or word processor that enables multiple authors to edit content asynchronously over many days and week, with each contributor&apos;s
	  changes being integrated into the resulting text and propagated on next load to the collaborators.</li><li>A tool that enables Web pages to be annotated with comments that are automatically made available to other users of the annotation service who access the same pages with suitable software. The software may be included in a user agent, or it may be supplied as an extension.</li>
          <li>An Integrated Development Environment (<abbr title="Integrated development Environment">IDE</abbr>) that supports the collaborative editing of program source code in real time (or asynchronously).</li>
          <li>A wiki that supports version control, for example by enabling authors to revert to prior versions of a page or to view the differences between two versions.</li>
	  <li>A midi or audio editing application that allows real-time synchronous audio content editing, or asynchronous content editing. Collaborators hear edited content on demand during a teleconference editing session or on content refresh when editing asynchronously.</li>
        </ul>

      <section id="distinctive-features">
        <h3>Our scope: distinctive features of collaboration tools</h3>
        <p>This document focuses on features unique to collaboration tools, rather than features which they share with other Web applications. Most especially this document avoids discussion of features applicable to software in general. However, any software that provides one or more of the features enumerated here may benefit from the user needs and corresponding requirements elaborated in the sections that follow.</p>
        <p>The distinctive capabilities of collaboration tools are illustrated by the examples described in the section: <a href="#collaboration-tools"></a>. It is important to consider how these features are manifested in the tool&apos;s user interface. From this perspective, the distinguishing features may be described as follows.</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Real-time and asynchronous co-editing</dt>
          <dd>A feature enabling multiple authors to edit the same content simultaneously or over days, weeks months, and years. In synchronous co-editing, the changes introduced by different authors in real-time are combined almost immediately, using algorithms such as operational transformation [[concurrency-control]]. The combined changes are then made immediately visible in all of the participating authors&apos; editing sessions. The effect is that each author may perceive, in real time,
		  <ul>
			  <li>Edits proposed by collaborators,</li>
			  <li>The location of other editors&apos; focus within content.</li>
		  </ul>
		  Asynchronous edits, on the other hand,  are made visible on document reload.</dd>
          <dt>Annotation of content with comments</dt>
          <dd>Some tools enable users to associate comments with parts of the content that is being read or edited. In systems such as word processors, replying to comments is supported, allowing threads of discussion to be associated with parts of a document.</dd>
          <dt>Comparing revisions</dt>
          <dd>Some systems can display the differences between revisions of content for purposes of comparison.</dd>
          <dt>Suggested changes</dt>
          <dd>Some word processors can show changes (insertions, deletions and formatting-related modifications) made by collaborators, which an editor can choose to accept or reject. These revisions are sometimes referred to as <dfn>suggested changes</dfn> or as <dfn>tracked changes</dfn>. Each change may be accompanied by metadata, for example the identity of the author who made the change, and a time stamp.</dd>
          <dt>Access controls</dt>
          <dd>Some collaborative environments support <em>access controls</em>, allowing restrictions to be imposed on modification of part or all of the content. Permission to modify content may be granted on a granular basis to specific individuals or to groups of users. For example, in a collaborative tool for creating fillable forms, some users may only be allowed to change the values of input fields (i.e., to complete a form), whereas others may be free to edit any aspect of the document, including the addition, deletion and rearrangement of form fields.</dd>
	</dl>

  <p>Collaboration tools differ widely in the nature of content that may be edited. They also differ widely in the user interfaces presented to users. For example:</p>
	  <ul>
      <li>Word processors typically provide a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG"><q>what you see is what you get</q> (<abbr title="what you see is what you get">WYSIWYG</abbr>)</a> interface based on a rendered view of the content.</li>
		  <li>Editors designed for source code or markup language text development do not provide a rendered view. In these applications,, indentation and syntax highlighting may be the only visual cues provided to the structure of the code or markup available in the editing environment.</li>
		  <li>In collaborative video editors, candidate video renditions may be played in side by side windows for purposes of comparison and editing decisioning.</li>
		  <li>By their very nature, audio alternatives presented in music or sound editing environments must be played sequentially, and their distinctions remembered by the user in the comparison and decisioning process.</li>
	  </ul>
    <p>As the preceding cases suggest, collaboration tools are not restricted by the kind of content that may be edited. Thus, tools that support editing of static images, mathematical notation, or other content types are also within the scope of this document. However, only collaboration-related aspects of any content editing environment are addressed here. Accessibility issues particular to creating and editing various types of content are not considered in this document.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless it is important that collaborative tools support the full range of editing functions associated with making web content accessible. Among others this would include the ability to add
	  headings, provide alternative text for images and add captions to videos.</p>
    <p>Some collaboration tools support accessibility by mapping unique keyboard commands. Some also organize their feature options in unique menus or uniquely located menus. We prefer collaboration tools that utilize standard menu organization and typical keyboard commands now well known to users from the stand-alone desktop environment. Standard controls require far less learning
    from the user, whereas specific accessibility modes with custom keyboard commands, and with menus that shift their location on screen pose significantly steep learning challenges to most users with disabilities, not just
    users with cognitive and learning disabilities.</p>

    <section id="need-definition">
      <h3>Defining user needs</h3>
      <p>Specific user needs are frequently defined both by   task required to achieve a particular goal and also by environmental conditions. Context matters. For example, the cognitive demands imposed by interacting with the collaboration-related features of an application depend not only on the needs and capabilities of the user, including the possible presence of assistive technology, but also on the context. A collaborative task that the user can perform independently while working alone in a distraction-free environment may quickly become cognitively burdensome when performed during a working teleconference session. Working with comments and suggested changes becomes more cognitively demanding when other authors are simultaneously editing the same content, and the user needs to be aware of their activities (e.g., to avoid introducing conflicting changes) while still performing the editing task. The use of different input types and methods, such as speech input or switch-based input, can significantly affect the amount of time required to enter and edit text, as well as the user&apos;s ability to respond to potentially disruptive changes introduced by collaborators.&apos;</p>
    </section>
            <section id="collab-a11y">
		            <h3>Collaboration tools and accessibility</h3>
	<p>By following established guidance, notably that of <cite>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</cite> [[wcag22]], designers of collaboration tools can help ensure that their user interfaces are <em>perceivable</em> to and <em>operable</em> by a wide range of users with disabilities. Following the Guidelines also enables user interfaces to be more <em>understandable</em>, and to be <em>robust</em> in their support for a range of user agents and assistive technologies. In addition, broadly applicable guidance on improving accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities has been published in [[coga-usable]]. However, implementing current guidelines and suggested practices is not sufficient by itself to ensure that the user interface of a collaboration tool can be understood and used efficiently by people with disabilities. Thus, conforming to WCAG may well be insufficient for collaborative environments. For example WCAG does not inform automated interface simplification &mdash; a general web accessibility requirement being considered in APA&apos;s <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/task-forces/adapt/">WAI-Adapt Task Force</a>.</p>
  <p>The collaboration features of these tools are necessarily complex. This can impose significant cognitive demands on many users, not only users with specialized accessibility requirements. This is especially true  for users of screen readers, screen magnification and color contrast assistive technologies, as well as for persons living with various cognitive and learning disabilities. For this reason, the unique cognitive demands established by collaborative content creation applications can impose barriers to access which are addressable, in part, by making appropriate software design and implementation choices. Additional control of cognitive demands can be achieved by using the application and any assistive technologies appropriately in a collaborative setting, and by ensuring that the social context in which the collaboration occurs supports participation by contributors with disabilities (see section <a href="#social"></a>).</p>
        <p>Many users cannot track updates on multiple locations simultaneously, rather, they must view and comprehend the interactive elements of the application&apos;s features  sequentially, for example in speech or braille for screen reader users. A screen reader or magnifier used in a collaborative application may well present suggested changes and comments in one section of the screen while the user is reading a document in a word processor. The user may also be expected to be communicating verbally with fellow collaborators (e.g., in an in-person or RTC meeting) while undertaking editing tasks or comparing multiple revisions of content. Moreover, in applications supporting real-time collaborative editing, incoming changes made by other contributors may alter the content that the user is reading or editing in real time. These cognitive demands can be exaserbated when one is working with an unfamiliar user interface such as a rarely used RTC client(See our RTC Accessibility User Requirements [[RAUR]] publication).</p>
        <p>Due to the cognitive demands created by collaboration tools in the practical and social contexts in which they are used, strategies for improving accessibility are desirable that extend beyond current W3C guidance.
Thus when we talk about collaborative tools we must consider accessibility burdens imposed by their
	concomitant complexity. In truth, collaborative tools are necessarily complex interfaces for all users, and not only persons with various disabilities. The salient point here is that a failure to design to accomodate persons with disabilities appropriately will inevitably prevent their participation in collaborative work. What constitutes challenging complexity for most users will inevitably become an insurmountable barrier for some persons with disabilities.</p>

	<p>A fairly common accessibility failure is the use of arbitrary color to flag edits put forth by different collaborators. However, identifying collaborators only by colorization  violates WCAG Success Criterion 1.4.1 as described below in <a href="#version-control-changes">User Need 11</a>.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="social">
	      <h2>Social Considerations</h2>
	      <p>Collaborative tools should support all identified accessibility features in order to provide comprehensive accessibility. However, it is unlikely all features will be needed by any individual collaborative team effort. We assume persons with disabilities are brought into collaborative teams because of the contributions they are expected to make in the project. Teams are encouraged to focus on accommodating the specific accessibility needs of participating team members in order to operate most efficiently and productively.</p>

        <h3>Scope and applicability of this document</h3>
        <p>Accessibility-related guidance provided in this document is applicable to a wide variety of tools. No unnecessary restriction is placed on the types of Web-based software to which it may reasonably be applied.</p>
        <p>If a tool implements one or more of the distinctive features described in section <a href="#distinctive-features"></a>, then the guidance in this document which addresses each such supported feature is relevant and applicable to the tool. Thus, the scope of the document includes any tool implemented using Web technologies that implements at least one of the distinctive features for which guidance is offered in the sections that follow.</p>
        <p>For example, an annotation tool supporting the association of shared comments with selected text in Web pages would offer only a single feature described in this document. For this reason, only section <a href="#annotations"></a> would be relevant to the tool.</p>

    <section id="notify">
      <h2>Notifications and Messages</h2>
      <p>Collaboration tools may send notifications to the user for a variety of reasons. For example, a user may be notified if a collaborator asynchronously submits changes to a document or project, or adds a comment. These notifications may be delivered via operating system facilities, or by a messaging service, such as e-mail or an instant message protocol. Moreover, the collaboration tool may support commenting, issue tracking, or other forms of interaction via external messaging. These optional capabilities are addressed in the following user needs and system requirements.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Need 15:</strong> Users who are easily distracted or overwhelmed need to receive only notifications that are crucially important to their collaborative activity.</li>
        <li><strong>REQ 15:</strong> Ensure that users can choose which types of notification are delivered, and which are suppressed, according to the nature of the information conveyed.</li>
        <li><strong>User Need 16:</strong> Users for whom reading text is slow or difficult need information that is important to the task at hand to be clearly distinguished and prioritized.</li>
        <li><strong>REQ 16A:</strong> Provide a mode of operation in which notifications are short, and links to more detailed information are included. In this mode, full details are not provided in the notification. For example, a user could be notified that a comment or issue has been created,  with the full text being available only via a link rather than as part of the notificational message itself.</li>

    <section id="access-control">
      <h2>Access Controls</h2>
      <p>A collaborative environment may provide access controls to restrict the modification of content to specified individuals or groups of users. Moreover, access controls may be applied to the entire content, as in a document which is marked as <em>read-only</em> in a text editor or office application, or they may restrict editing to designated parts. Depending on the capabilities of the application, permissions may be changed by an authorized user during a collaborative editing session.</p>
      <ul>

    <section id="conventions">
      <h2>General Guidance on Implementing Accessibility Features of Collaborative Environments</h2>
      <p>To facilitate effective collaboration, applications should be designed to respect conventions of user interface design that are likely to be expected by users, including those who have disabilities.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Need 19:</strong> Users with learning or cognitive disabilities or who use assistive technologies need to learn and use collaboration tools efficiently.
	</li>
        <li><strong>REQ 19A:</strong> In implementing collaboration features, follow established user interface conventions and design patterns. For example, use conventional terminology, labels, or icons for functionality that may be familiar to users.</li>
        <li><strong>REQ 19B:</strong> Support the accessibility-related features of the user&apos;s operating system, user agent, and assistive technology. For example, some assistive technologies, such as screen readers, have features designed specifically for reading comments and suggested changes in textual content, which should be supported instead of defining application-specific functionality or keyboard commands that accomplish the same purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>REQ 19C:</strong> Make collaborative features available via an <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> to allow interoperability with tools with which the user may already be familiar, and which may better satisfy a person&apos;s specific accessibility-related needs. For example, a revision control system could interoperate via an <abbr>API</abbr> with a user&apos;s chosen text editor or integrated development environment.</li>
      </ul>
      <aside class="note">
      <p>Provision of an <abbr>API</abbr> does not diminish the importance of ensuring that user interfaces provided by the application satisfy accessibility requirements. Nor is REQ 19C applicable to all collaborative environments. For example, some applications are highly dependent on editing functions specific to the tool itself, and should not be expected to interoperate with external editors.</p>
      <p>Note that learning an unfamiliar user interface is difficult or impossible for some people with learning or cognitive disabilities. Consequently, offering interoperability via an <abbr>API</abbr> with tools that are already familiar to the user  can remove otherwise insurmountable barriers to access in such cases.</p>

	    <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
	    <p>The Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group gratefully acknowledges the vision and multi-year effort of our <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/task-forces/research-questions/wiki/Main_Page">Research Questions Task Force (RQTF)</a> in developing this publication. In addition we wish to acknowledge the contributions of all who provided comments and suggestions as this publication moved through multiple revisions. We especially thank our colleagues in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/cognitive/">Cognitive and Learning Disabilities (COGA)</a> Task Force for their particular diligence providing comments and suggestions. Without COGA&apos;s help this publication would have been far less formidable. Lastly, we particularly acknowledge and thank David Swallow for his work coordinating issue resolution between COGA and RQTF as our officially designated liaison. He helped us hear each other&apos;s concerns more clearly, and that lead to more comprehensive and nuanced requirements above.</p>
