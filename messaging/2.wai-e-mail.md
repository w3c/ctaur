Dear WAI Interest Group,

W3C WAI invites you to comment on a Draft W3C Group Note:
  Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements
  https://www.w3.org/TR/ctaur/

@@ This is the planned last draft before we publish this as a W3C Group Note.  

Overview:

Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements ("CTAUR") covers accessibility user needs, requirements, and scenarios for collaborative content creation and development tools. It addresses features and capabilities unique to interactive, real-time, or asynchronous collaborative applications. This includes co-editing, revision tracking, and in-line comments.

The scope of CTAUR is broader than web-based word processors; it encompasses a variety of applications across diverse hardware and software environments to comprehensively address accessibility in collaborative editing technologies.

The solutions identified in this document are intended to influence the evolution of future accessibility guidelines, technical specifications, or features of collaboration tools and assistive technologies. They are relevant to software developers who contribute to developing the collaborative experience.


Seeking input:

We encourage broad review from a cross-disability perspective. This draft incorporates substantial revisions made in response to comments on the previous Working Drafts by various stakeholders, including especially the Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility (COGA) Task Force @@ https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/cognitive-a11y-tf. These comments led to the addition of significant requirements as well as to clarification of the document's scope. We especially request comments on the following four questions:

1.  We came to understand the collaborative editing environment in terms of managing complexity. We observed that many word processing, spread sheet, software development, and media development environments are themselves intrinsically complex. To this, collaborative tooling adds a further layer of complexity: the management of proposed, accepted, and rejected edits from multiple participants. Does this framing make sense? Is its importance clearly communicated by the document?

2.  Do we delineate between the content creation elements of software and those relating to managing collaboration sufficiently? Is the distinction meaningfully communicated? Do you agree with this scoping?

3.  We inserted a section in our Introduction on Social Considerations. This brief section is included to communicate which stakeholders we regard responsible for which aspects of collaborative efforts. Is this helpful?

4.  We created a glossary to define the term "WYSIWYG" in response to a comment.  Are there other terms we use you would like defined in the glossary?
