Dear WAI Interest Group,

W3C WAI announces the publication of a W3C Group Note:
  Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements
  https://www.w3.org/TR/ctaur/

Overview:

Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements ("CTAUR") covers accessibility user needs, requirements, and scenarios for collaborative content creation and development tools. It addresses features and capabilities unique to interactive, real-time, or asynchronous collaborative applications. This includes co-editing, revision tracking, and in-line comments.

The scope of CTAUR is broader than web-based word processors; it encompasses a variety of applications across diverse hardware and software environments to comprehensively address accessibility in collaborative editing technologies.

The solutions identified in this document are intended to influence the evolution of future accessibility guidelines, technical specifications, or features of collaboration tools and assistive technologies. They are relevant to software developers who contribute to developing the collaborative experience.

To comment, please open a new issue in the document's GitHub repository:
