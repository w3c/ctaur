_Subject:_ Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements (CTAUR) - W3C Group Note Published

Dear WAI Interest Group,

W3C WAI is pleased to announce the publication of the W3C Group Note:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.w3.org/TR/ctaur/<br>

Collaboration Tools Accessibility User Requirements (CTAUR, pronounced 'see-tower') covers accessibility user needs, requirements, and scenarios for collaborative content creation and development tools. It addresses features and capabilities unique to interactive, real-time, or asynchronous collaborative applications. This includes co-editing, revision tracking, and in-line comments.

The scope of CTAUR is broader than web-based word processors; it encompasses a variety of applications across diverse hardware and software environments to comprehensively address accessibility in collaborative editing technologies.

The solutions identified in this document are intended to influence the evolution of future accessibility guidelines, technical specifications, or features of collaboration tools and assistive technologies. They are relevant to software developers who contribute to developing the collaborative experience.

We welcome comments for a potential future update. If you have comments, please open a new issue in the document's GitHub repository: https://github.com/w3c/ctaur/issues/new<br>
Please create separate GitHub issues for each topic, rather than commenting on multiple topics in a single issue.<br>
If it's not feasible for you to use GitHub, send comments in email to: public-rqtf@w3.org. Please: 1. put your comments in the body of the message, not as an attachment; 2. start your e-mail subject line with: [CTAUR].
